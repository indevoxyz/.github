**What is Indevo?**  
A modular suite of tiny, focused web utilities, each solving one task with speed and clarity. Just tools that work.

**Philosophy**  
> Fine, I'll build it myself.

We create tools that should exist. Each is built independently, open source, and minimal by design.

---

**Repos**

Each tool lives in its own repository. See pinned repos or visit [indevo.xyz](https://indevo.xyz) to explore live versions.
